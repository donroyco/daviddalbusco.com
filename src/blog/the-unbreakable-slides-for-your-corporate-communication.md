> Did you have a look at Bob’s presentation? He used the wrong logo, again.

Something that never miss to surprise me when I attend professional presentations, is to notice how much they can vary, even within the same company. Templates, formatting, palette of colors, fonts, logo, you name it, all of these tend to be fluctuant. Even if some companies try to ensure that their corporate identity and design are the one used in their employee’s slides, it is rarely consistent.

On the other hand, when we created [DeckDeckGo](https://deckdeckgo.com), a web editor for presentations, we designed it to be powered by self-contained templates that may, or may not, allow a certain number of features, with no other limitation that what the web can do.

Base on these two observations, we are thrilled to unveil today our offering for [enterprise](https://deckdeckgo.com/enterprise) customers.

*****

### Templates And Options That Match Your CI/CD

With this new offering, we aim to collaborate with your company to provide you our new kind of editor for presentations and assist you the best we can to make you implement your CI/CD in your slides. Together with your designer or according your guidelines, we create a set of unbreakable templates to apply your design, logo, colors, fonts, styles and any other options. Those will be used by all your collaborators.

But, there is more and here are some of the main features we have in mind for companies!

*****

#### More Than Static Content

Templates are made with the web and have no other limits than what it can do. It notably means that if your business do offer web solutions, you can integrated these within your slides.

*****

#### Collaborate And Shared Library

There is no team without communication. That’s why, multiple users can edit a presentation at the same time and are able to express and exchange comments, without having to use multiple communications channels.

Likewise, with the help of a company’s media library, collaborators are able to share their assets’ resources.

*****

#### Always Up-To-Date

Over time your corporate style will evolve. We can make the propagation of these changes easier.

*****

#### Custom Domain, In Housing and Share Privately

You can publish your decks under your own domain name. It is also possible to create private links to prevent access to your published content.

If you rather like to integrate DeckDeckGo in your infrastructure and private network rather than using our SASS platform, we are open to the ideas too.

*****

### And So Much More

These above main features are the one we think are specific to business but DeckDeckGo is so much more than that.

*****

#### Edit Anywhere, Showcase Everywhere

The editor is available anywhere, it is a Progressive Web App!

Presentations work on computers, phones, tablets and more. They are published as standalone apps.

*****

#### Polls

Engage with your audience in real time by running polls within your slides. Get them involved during your presentations with their smartphones and show the results live.

*****

#### Editing

Syntax highlighted code, math formulas, charts, Youtube, Unsplash, Tenor, Google fonts. We have integrated the useful services directly in the editor and are providing many components to render information smoothly.

*****

#### Remote control

Control your presentations remotely, draw over your slides and set a timer from your phone or tablet.

*****

#### Speaker notes

Write notes for your slides. If you wish, it would even be possible to publish these within your slides.

*****

#### Open Source

DeckDeckGo is open source. All the code of our applications and components are available on [Github](http://github.com/deckgo/deckdeckgo).

We encourage enterprise to adopt this approach but we do understand if you prefer to keep your corporate templates private.

*****

#### Developer Kit

All public features used by our editor are available as a developer kit therefore, if you rather like to prepare your presentation with HTML or Markdown, go for it `npm init deckeckgo` .

To infinity and beyond
